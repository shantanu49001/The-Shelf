- `Application Software Development Principles:`

Separation of Concerns (SoC):

The app's design follows the principle of SoC, ensuring a clear division between different software components.

User Interface (UI), Logic, and Database layers are well-separated, making the codebase modular and maintainable.

![app_demo](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/dhtmlprototyping-091003225803-phpapp01/95/slide-51-1024.jpg)

Easy Debugging and Management:

With SoC, debugging becomes more manageable, as issues are isolated to specific components.
Maintenance and updates become easier, as changes in one layer do not significantly impact others.

- `Seamless User experience Lowering Delay and Crashes`

The app utilizes Kotlin Coroutines to handle background tasks, such as fetching book data and loading content.

This asynchronous approach ensures a smooth and responsive user experience, minimizing crashes and delays.

## App Limitations and Future versions[under development]

- `Integration of ML and native application `:
The app will leverage machine learning (ML) models to suggest books based on users' likes and ratings. These models will analyze user preferences and interactions with the app to offer personalized book recommendations.

![ml_m](https://www.springml.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Operationalizing-ML-models-with-MLOps-Icon.png)

- `Be with LikeMinds:(v 1.2)`

Users will be placed in groups based on shared interests, such as favorite authors or specific book themes. These groups will enhance social interactions and foster a sense of community among like-minded readers.


- `Personalized reminders(v 1.2)`

 The application will utilize ML algorithms to set reminders based on the user's prime reading time. This ensures that users receive timely notifications to read or continue with their chosen books when they are most likely to engage with the app.

 - `Advanced ML Integration (version 1.3)`

 Advanced ML models will be integrated with OpenCV support, enabling users to search for books by clicking images. Using computer vision technology, the app will allow users to snap pictures of book covers, and ML models will recognize and find matching books in the app's database.
